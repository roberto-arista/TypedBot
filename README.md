# TypedBot
A type annotated wrapper around [DrawBot](https://www.drawbot.com)

## FAQs

+ First of all, why? Don't we already have DrawBot?

+ Wait, what? Type Annotations? Isn't Python dynamically typed?

+ Why should someone use type annotations? It is extra code and I am lazy.

+ That's an interesting topic, I want to know more.

    You can start read a few PEPs related to type annotatios:
    + [PEP 484 -- Type Hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)
    + [PEP 526 -- Syntax for Variable Annotations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/)
    + [PEP 3107 -- Function Annotations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/)

    I also found these talks useful:
    - [Gradual Typing in Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj_9TyT3V98)
    - [Bernat Gabor - Type hinting (and mypy) - PyCon 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTrjTAPnA_k)

+ If type annotations are not checked at runtime, how do I know if I am doing something wrong?

    You need to use a static type checker, like [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org) or [pyre](https://pyre-check.org). You could tie the static type checker to your favourite code editor linter functionality. I use [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com) with the [SublimeLinter](http://www.sublimelinter.com/en/stable/) plugin. You can install mypy as [extension](https://github.com/fredcallaway/SublimeLinter-contrib-mypy) for the SublimeLinter plugin.

+ Why a wrapper? Couldn't you just insert the annotations inside the DrawBot API?

    This would be possible, but consider that the DrawBot API makes an extensive use of duck typing in the way it structures its API. For example, when you pass a coordinate to a function like [`text(txt, (x, y), align=None)`](https://www.drawbot.com/content/text/drawingText.html?highlight=text#drawBot.text), DrawBot does not really care if you pass a `tuple`, a `list`, a `namedtuple`, a class acting like a sequence (like a custom `Vector` class). DrawBot says Â«Two numbers? Cool, I don't need anything more, let's drawÂ». That's very cool and flexible, but flexibility sometimes can lead to bugs. Annotating this kind of API might be difficult and it can generate ugly code. And I don't really want my contribution to DrawBot to be remembered for being ugly ðŸ¥².

+ Wait, did you say Duck Typing? Like the animal?

    "If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck" see [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) and [2](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DNeRD.jpg)

+ Ok, sold. I want to try it. How can I install it?

    `pip install git+https://github.com/roberto-arista/TypedBot`

    Be aware, it's the first package I release, so I probably did something wrong in `setup.py` or similar. Open an issue if something goes wrong and I'll try to figure out a solution.

+ Wait, is this stable? Can I use it in production?

    Yes, no, almost. DrawBot is stable and well tested. TypedBot, not yet. Some tests are still failing, and part of the DrawBot API is not annotated yet (see imageObject). I am using this module in a couple of projects and the experience acquired will probably push me to adjust or change some things. IMHO you can use it, but you need to be a bit flexible

+ Is the TypedBot API equivalent to the DrawBot API?

    Not completely. Type annotations syntax allows to annotate functions and methods of any kind in Python, but the result is not always optimal. Considered that this wrapper is separate from drawBot and that it does not break any existing functionality, I decided to change a few things to make the source code easier and cleaner.

    For this reason, I make a heavy use of dataclasses and enums. In this way the function interface looks cleaner.

+ Ok, so how do I know what differs between the two APIs?

    The source code of TypedBot and the DrawBot docs are the best reference.
    These are the principles I followed when changing the API
    + Use `Optional` as less as possible. DrawBot makes a large use of `None` in function signatures. For example when you need to set a transparent color with `fill`, `stroke` and so on. 

+ This project is cool, I want to help you. How can I contribute to it?

    That's great! Right now I see three areas where I could need some help:
    + Some tests are still failing. I'll work on these, but if you have time to figure out what's wrong, be my guest!
    + It would be nice to have some docs online. I don't know what these docs should show, probably each method should have a link to the drawBot's original version and the annotations.
    + Part of the API is not annotated yet. For example the `imageObject`. It has a large API (about 100 methods?) and I seldom use it. So, it's not my priority to annotate it.

    If you want to contribute, I suggest to:
    + fork the repo
    + clone it on your machine
    + install it locally in editable mode with pip
    ```
    cd path/to/cloned/repo
    pip install -e .
    ```

+ What about the license?

    TypedBot has the same license of DrawBot, so you can use it wherever you use DrawBot
